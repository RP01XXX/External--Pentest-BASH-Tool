# Summary
These tools are used to make pentesting a little more automatic and easy. Verify  what the client has provided to determine which OSINT tool you use. 
Then move to vulnerability scanning and identification.

1. OSINT-IP-Finder
  This is for tests that only provide IP ranges and you need to scan. This performs your enumeration phases. 
  This is considered done for now. This is run first and then you run OSINT seeker
  
2. OSINT Seeker
  This is for tests where you only have URLS.
  
3. External-Identification
  This performs vulnerability scans, identifies services and parses data, and captures webpages.

  
After tool  3, you would begin your manual work.
  
 
These are all in progress and I would love your opinion on this work to make it better!
