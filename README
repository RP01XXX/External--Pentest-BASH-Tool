# Summary
There are two tools here for external pentesting.

1. OSINT-IP-Finder
  This is for tests that only provide IP ranges and you need to scan. This performs your enumeration phases. 
  This is considered done for now. This is run first and then you run OSINT seeker
  
2. OSINT Seeker
  This is for tests where you only have URLS.
  
 
These are all in progress and I would love your opinion on this work to make it better!
