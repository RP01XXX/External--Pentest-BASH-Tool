# Start Here
Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to perform our general easy day 1 scans in an automated way. 


#### File Structure
We have the Testing_Template.sh, this is what we use to test our initial integrations. Its a stripped version of the code that allows us to test features and functions.



#### Future Integrations
1. Add additional tools
2. Recursively perform scans so it uses results to continue more scanning
3. The outputs are exported into specific folders/files for review so for example: Nmap exports results to HTTP Folder, etc and feeds into eyewitness.
4. Idk how do we automate our lives.
